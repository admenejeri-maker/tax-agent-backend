# Session Report — Perplexity-Style UI Rounding
**Date**: 2026-02-16 00:43
**Session ID**: b2cb6e60-4da5-4483-ac6f-b45c5457996f
**Previous Session**: Same conversation, continuing from voice config alignment

## Session Objective
Implement Perplexity AI's differentiated border-radius styling across the Scoop AI frontend.

## Decisions Made
1. **Search input bar**: Keep at `32px` (`rounded-[32px]`) — matches Perplexity's search bar
2. **Content cards**: Use `16px` (`rounded-2xl`) — matches Perplexity's response cards
3. **Pills/buttons**: Keep `rounded-full` — matches Perplexity's pill style
4. **Product card container**: Style via `.products-grid` wrapper (not individual `ProductCard` component)

## Modified Files (Uncommitted in frontend/)
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/globals.css` | Updated `.product-card` to `border-radius: 16px`; Added `.products-grid` container styles (bg, border, 16px radius, padding, box-shadow) |
| `src/components/chat-response.tsx` | Tip boxes `rounded-[32px]` → `rounded-2xl`; Added `products-grid` wrapper div |
| `src/components/Chat.tsx` | Search input bar confirmed at `rounded-[32px]` |
| `src/components/empty-screen.tsx` | Category cards `rounded-[32px]` → `rounded-2xl` |

## Key Findings
- **Root Cause of Product Card Issue**: `ProductCard.tsx` does NOT use `.product-card` CSS class — the class was orphaned/unused
- **ProductCard.tsx** uses inline Tailwind (`border-b border-gray-100`) with no border-radius
- **Fix approach**: Applied container styling to `.products-grid` wrapper instead of individual cards

## Build Status
- ✅ `npm run build` — 0 errors
- ⚠️ `@theme` / `@apply` lint warnings (Tailwind v4 directives, non-critical)

## Open Issue
- **User reports no visual change visible** — likely browser cache or the CSS changes not reaching the rendered component. Needs deeper DOM inspection to verify CSS specificity and class application. This was under investigation when session ended.

## Next Steps
1. 🔴 **Deep DOM investigation** — Inspect rendered HTML in browser DevTools to confirm which CSS classes are actually applied to the product card elements
2. 🔴 **Verify `.products-grid` class is actually rendered** — Confirm `chat-response.tsx` changes are compiled and served
3. 🟡 **Hard refresh + cache clear** — `Cmd+Shift+R` on localhost:3000
4. 🟡 **Commit frontend rounding changes** — Once visual verification passes
