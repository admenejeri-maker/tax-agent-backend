# Session Report — 2026-02-14 Evening
**Session ID**: 4eba013c-b1a5-4ef3-b581-ce7ac8b88b97
**Duration**: ~5 hours (15:30 - 20:53)

## Modified Files

### Frontend
- `src/stores/useSessionStore.ts` — Added `isSessionReady` flag, async `initializeSession`
- `src/components/Chat.tsx` — Gated `loadSessions()` behind `isSessionReady`
- `src/lib/apiClient.ts` — Added `credentials: 'include'` to `enrollApiKey`, 401 recovery path

### Backend
- `main.py` — CORS fix: expanded wildcard `*` to explicit origins when `allow_credentials=True`

## Decisions Made
1. Used `isSessionReady` gate pattern (vs debounce/retry) for race condition — simplest, most reliable
2. CORS fix applied in all modes (not just debug) — Cloud Run deployments also need explicit origins
3. Deployed backend first, then frontend — backend CORS fix was prerequisite

## Deployments
- Backend `backend-ai-1` → Cloud Run europe-west1 ✅
- Frontend `scoop-frontend` → Cloud Run europe-west1 ✅
- Both GitHub repos updated with latest commits

## Open Questions
- Need to verify Incognito fix works in production (manual test needed)
- Product display fix is next priority (already planned from previous session)
